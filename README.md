# Determining_COVID-19_Survival_Rate_ML
COVID-19 is a member of the Coronaviridae genus that has spread throughout the entire world. A virus that is not preventable causes unanticipated damage to human life, finances, and economic frameworks seen in all nations worldwide. Physicians and other health professionals have a lot of work associated with this disease. As of October 27, more than 1.1 million individuals had died from this viral epidemic, which has infected over 43 million people worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading throughout India, where there are currently the 2 nd highest number of cases and third-highest number of fatalities worldwide. A model is created in this study to look at and assess how this sickness spreads. Machine learning and the creation of computer-aided diagnostic tools can lessen this workload. Any scientific investigation into this illness will aid in its early management. The COVID-19 dataset was used in this experiment to build decision tree ensemble model. In order to handle the missing values and categorical data, we first carried out data pretreatment. Four different Machine Learning algorithms namely Random Forest Classifier, XG Boost Classifier, LGBM Classifier and Cat Boost Classifier have been considered. The numbers of confirmed cases, patients who recovered, and individuals who passed away from COVID-19 in Mexico within a specific time period were taken from a Kaggle dataset.
